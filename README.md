SDLC Group Project

What is the purpose of the software? 
In this assignment, we will create a program that will work as a library for a user’s games. Some of the features will include being able to favorite and track the progress of their games.
How will the software solve a particular problem?
The software will allow a user to store and keep track of what games they play, favorite them and keep track of the game progress.
What are the minimum features that should be implemented? – also referred to as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
The minimum features would be:
 user authentication (require and handle authentication of the user). 
 game storage (being able to add or delete games from the library).
 progress tracking (user will be able to track the progress of a game with visuals).
For the security measures:
Hashing to create unique IDs for the user accounts
Password hashing
Use of encryption for storing passwords in the database
Input validation



 
User Stories:
1.  I want to be able to log into my library using my username and password.
2.  I want to be able to upload/delete games into/from my library and track their progress.
3.  I want to be able to favorite my games so I can view the ones I am most interested in.
4.  I want my personal information to be stored securely and I want to be the only one with access to my library, through user authentication.
